				<h4>Software Package Implementation</h4>
				<p style="text-align:left;">When implementing an off-the-shelf software product, you need to ensure all aspects of the implementation are covered.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">We will evaluate, and if required, manage, the needs for:
				<ul style="text-align:left;">
					<li>user training,</li>
					<li>support training,</li>
					<li>security, user access, hacking prevention,</li>
					<li>integration with other systems,</li>
					<li>backup regimes,</li>
					<li>organisational change management,</li>
					<li>tailoring,</li>
					<li>configuration.</li>
				</ul> 
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">We can also provide implementation project management services, for larger, more complex systems.

				<h4>External vendor management</h4>
				<p style="text-align:left;">When woking with a software vendor (especially one based overseas), you can encounter a myriad of problems, ranging 
				from simple misunderstandings, to major technical issues that require "boots on the ground" to look after your interests. 
				<BR><BR>Remember, a vendor is primarily looking after their interests, not yours.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">We will:
					<ul style="text-align:left;">
						<li>manage the vendor,</li>
						<li>manage the implementation process,</li>
						<li>work with the vendor to overcome misunderstandings and issues,</li>
						<li>assist with technical issues,</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">to ensure the implementation goes according to plan, and you ultimately receive the outcome your were expecting.

				<h4>Project monitoring</h4>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Major implementation being planned?</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">How sure are you that system integration, feature sets, configuration, user training, and organisatinal change management have been analysed and planned for?</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">If you have a major in-house software implementation, how effective is your project management governing the implementation?</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Don't let your next project be another expensive failure. 
				We will provide a very high level of comfort that all aspects of the project planning and implementation have been allowed for.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">We will provide an evaluation of the current state of the project, whether in the proposal, planning or implementation stage.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">We can provide overall project governance and project/program planning services.</p>
				<p style="text-align:left;">Your interests are of paramount importance. We provide totally independent advice, not constrained by internal politics, powerplays and personalities.</p>
