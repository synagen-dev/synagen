Your personal information is important to us</TD></TR><TR><TD>Synagen recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policy will govern how Synagen handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy. Synagen is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our privacy policy not only complies with relevant laws but represents industry best practice.</TD></TR><TR><TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="2"></a>2. Synagen Membership</TD></TR><TR><TD>Synagen has implemented a membership system, designed to offer users a more rewarding and personalised customer experience ("Membership"). To obtain the full benefits of Membership, 
users are required to register with Synagen and login as members each time they visit the Network. 
However, even if you don't sign up for Membership or log onto the Network as a member, you are still able to access many 
of the Network sites and much of the Synagen content. You can learn more about enhancing your online experience through 
Membership by clicking <a href="http://Synagen.com.au/membership/">here</a>.</TD></TR>

  <TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="3"></a>3. Collecting personal information about you</TD></TR><TR><TD>There are two main ways we collect information about you:
<BR><BR>
<b>If you do not log in as a Synagen member</b>
<BR>Whenever you visit our site, some information, such as your IP address may be recorded on our system. 
No personal details are recorded and no attempt is made to store cookies, popup adverts or any other information or program on your computer.
Your IP address is recorded simply to track malicious users who attempt to damage our systems or extract information from our databases. 
The information we collect about you remains anonymous, and we do not link it to any other personal information. 
Therefore if you have not identified yourself on the site, such as by registering for Membership or logging on as a member, 
we will not link a record of your usage of our Network to you personally.
<BR><BR>
<b>	If you log in as a Synagen member</b>
<BR>	Once you have become a Synagen member, we collect personal information about you in order to provide you with the 
full benefits of Membership. When you first register for Membership, we collect information from you directly and also 
from time to time thereafter if you provide us additional information.
<BR><BR>	
Once you have logged on as a member, we keep a record of how you use the Network. This helps us to build a profile 
of what interests you, so that we can personalise your experience of the Network and publish you information which is 
directly relevant to your interests.
<BR><BR>	
Any further collection of your personal information than that explained above will only occur with consent from you. 
Synagen only collects information from your use of our Network. We do not collect information about you from other 
organizations or from websites outside the Network that you may visit.

<TR><TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="4"></a>4. Preserving your privacy</TD></TR><TR><TD>Surveys show that most internet users are concerned about their privacy, want to keep control of their personal information, and do not trust many of the web sites which they visit. In fact, research shows around a third of internet users give false information online rather than saying who they really are.
<BR><BR>	
Synagen understands that even with our privacy policy, some people still will not feel comfortable disclosing their 
personal information in order to become a Synagen member. So if you don't feel comfortable with disclosing your real 
identity, but you still want to take advantage of Synagen Membership, then you can register for Membership using a 
pseudonym (or "nym") - a different name. This way, you choose your own nym, which might be "Joe Bloggs" or "Jane Doe" and 
that's what we will call you. However, any advertisers on the Network are never given information that identifies you as 
an individual (such as your name or your email address), unless you have given us your express consent to disclose such 
information.

Our use of cookies and applets</TD></TR><TR><TD>	Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies (for more information on disabling cookies, <a href="http://www.synagen.net/cookies.html">click here</a>. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Network.  For instance, you may not be able to login to Synagen.
    <BR><BR>
	The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what is offered by Synagen, because they can help personalise your 
    experience of our website. They can make it easier for you to shop online and can ensure that information provided to 
you is most relevant to your interests. Cookies can provide us with aggregated information on how people use our websites, 
and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Network. We also use cookies to operate the 
Membership system, as they help us to identify visitors to the site who have previously registered.
<BR><BR>
	Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. 
The cookies simply contain a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our 
website, almost like a continuing questionnaire.

(b), your password; (c) your secret question; (d) your country and (e) your state and (f) your postcode.

information sent to you. If you are receiving promotional information about Synagen or its affiliates and do not wish to 
receive this information any longer, you may remove your name from our list either by visiting the website from which the 
communication was sent and following the instructions on how to withdraw your information from that site (where that
