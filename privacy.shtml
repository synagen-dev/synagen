Your personal information is important to us</TD></TR><TR><TD>icon recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policy will govern how icon handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy. icon is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our privacy policy not only complies with relevant laws but represents industry best practice.</TD></TR><TR><TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="2"></a>2. icon Membership</TD></TR><TR><TD>icon has implemented a membership system, designed to offer users a more rewarding and personalised customer experience ("Membership"). To obtain the full benefits of Membership, users are required to register with icon and login as members each time they visit the Network. However, even if you don't sign up for Membership or log onto the Network as a member, you are still able to access many of the Network sites and much of the icon content. You can learn more about enhancing your online experience through Membership by clicking <a href="http://icon.com.au/membership/">here</a>.</TD></TR><TR><TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="3"></a>3. Collecting personal information about you</TD></TR><TR><TD>There are two main ways we collect information about you:
<BR><BR>
<b>If you do not log in as a icon member</b>
<BR>Whenever you visit our site, our servers automatically record information about your usage of the Network such as the time of the visit, its duration and the pages which you visit. This is intended to help us to understand what parts of our Network our users enjoy the most, and to help us to ensure that any advertising is most directly relevant to your interests. The information we collect about you remains anonymous, and we do not link it to any other personal information. Therefore if you have not identified yourself on the site, such as by registering for Membership or logging on as a member, we will not link a record of your usage of our Network to you personally.
<BR><BR>
	If you do not want us to retain any information at all, even in an anonymous form, you can use the Preferences on your browser program to remove all cookies and set the browser not to accept cookies in the future.  For more information on disabling cookies, <a href="http://www.iconmusic.net/cookies.htm">click here</a>

<BR><BR>
<b>	If you log in as a icon member</b>
<BR>	Once you have become a icon member, we collect personal information about you in order to provide you with the full benefits of Membership. When you first register for Membership, we collect information from you directly and also from time to time thereafter if you provide us additional information.
<BR><BR>	
	Once you have logged on as a member, we keep a record of how you use the Network. This helps us to build a profile of what interests you, so that we can personalise your experience of the Network and publish you information which is directly relevant to your interests.
<BR><BR>	
	Any further collection of your personal information than that explained above will only occur with consent from you. icon only collects information from your use of our Network. We do not collect information about you from other organizations or from websites outside the Network that you may visit.
</TD></TR><TR><TD bgcolor=""#FFFFFF"" class=clipheader><SPAN STYLE=""font-family:arial,verdana,san-serif;font-size:10px;color:#003399"">.......................................................................................................................................<BR><BR></SPAN><a name="4"></a>4. Preserving your privacy</TD></TR><TR><TD>Surveys show that most internet users are concerned about their privacy, want to keep control of their personal information, and do not trust many of the web sites which they visit. In fact, research shows around a third of internet users give false information online rather than saying who they really are.
<BR><BR>	
	icon understands that even with our privacy policy, some people still will not feel comfortable disclosing their personal information in order to become a icon member. So if you don't feel comfortable with disclosing your real identity, but you still want to take advantage of icon Membership, then you can register for Membership using a pseudonym (or "nym") - a different name. This way, you choose your own nym, which might be "Joe Bloggs" or "Jane Doe" and that's what we will call you. We won't know who you really are, but we will still be able to find out what you like most on our Network and therefore give you the most enjoyable and customised experience of the Network possible. This also helps us to match the advertising on our site to the people most likely to be interested in those ads (which help to pay for the cost of operating the Network).  However, the advertisers on the Network are never given information that identifies you as an individual (such as your name or your email address), unless you have given us your express consent to disclose such information.

Our use of cookies and applets</TD></TR><TR><TD>	Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies (for more information on disabling cookies, <a href="http://www.iconmusic.net/cookies.html">click here</a>. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Network.  For instance, you may not be able to login to Icon.
	
<BR><BR>
	The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what is offered by icon, because they can help personalise your experience of our website. They can make it easier for you to shop online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests. Cookies can provide us with aggregated information on how people use our websites, and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Network. We also use cookies to operate the Membership system, as they help us to identify visitors to the site who have previously registered.

<BR><BR>
	Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies simply contain a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our website, almost like a continuing questionnaire.
